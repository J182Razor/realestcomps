<h1>About Realest Comps</h1>

<p>This is my final project at Flatiron School's online campus. This app will soon grow to offer analytics data for the property researched and surrounding neighborhood. Eventually this project will crunch all of the numbers, instantly giving real estate investors every data point they need to decide on whether to invest in a property.</p>
